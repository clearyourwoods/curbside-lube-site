# Mobile Oil Caddie — Static Site (no build)
This version is a single‑page site using plain HTML/CSS/JS. Works on GitHub Pages without build tools.

## Deploy (easiest: Deploy from a branch)
1. Create a repo (e.g., `mobile-oil-caddie`).
2. Click **Add file → Upload files** and drag **all files and folders** inside this folder (including `src` and `public`) into GitHub, then **Commit**.
3. Repo → **Settings → Pages** → **Source: Deploy from a branch** → Branch: `main`, Folder: `/ (root)` → Save.
4. Your site will be at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/` within a minute.

You can also use GitHub Actions if you prefer, but this no-build version doesn't require it.

## Email
The **Email Request** button opens a mailto to `clearyourwoods@gmail.com`. Edit in `script.js` if needed.
